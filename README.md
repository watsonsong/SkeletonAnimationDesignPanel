In this project you can find the source code of DragonBones' Flash Pro based design panel, which is a visual editer for skeleton animation editing. With the design panel, designers can easily convert flash timeline based animation to skeleton animation, edit it and export it to texture file for developers. 

Following steps show you how to use the source code:  
1. Make sure you have installed Flash Builder with Flex SDK 4.0 or later version.  
2. Make sure you have got [SeletonAnimationLibrary](https://github.com/DragonBones/SkeletonAnimationLibrary) project.  
3. Open Flash Builder and create a Flex project named SkeletonAnimationDesignPanel.  
4. Change project location to SkeletonAnimationDesignPanel's location to make sure the IDE can find the source code.  
5  Change complie parameters to "-locale en_US zh_CN ja_JP fr_FR -source-path ./locale/{locale} -allow-source-path-overlap=true -default-script-limits 256 180 -default-size 640 480".  
6. Import SeletonAnimationLibrary project.  
7. (Optional) Change project theme to "Graphite".  
8. Test and have fun.
